		<h2>Act I: Preparation</h2>
		<ul>
			<!-- D: Hi. Are you making a system right now? -->
			<li>So you're writing an app?</li>
			<!-- R: You bet I am! -->
			<!-- D: Have you wondered about the technologies and approaches to use? -->
			<!-- R: Derp... -->
			<!-- D: Okay, how about this? I've heard that REST is the new black. -->
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section class="slide decorated">
		<h2>Why REST?</h2>
		<ul>
			<!-- R: Indeed, my fellow, indeed. REST is as the first breath of spring to the frostbitten tundra of APIs. Behold: it has found many a follower among the young folk, who appreciate the laconic form of meddling with data matter. -->
			<li>Popular with good language support</li>
			<!-- D: Any other pros, or just the minor weather-related epiphany? -->
			<li>Simple usage via hypermedia</li>
			<!-- R: Hypermedia - the modern-day Enigma! (BONUS QUESTION) -->
			<!-- D: Cool. You're set. -->
		</ul>
	</section>
	
	<section class="slide decorated">
		<h2>Why not?</h2>
		<ul>
			<!-- R: Not sure. The business domain could contain behaviours that do not map cleanly to REST, and that are non-reversible - the domain might "transcend the data-driven". (Something in Traditional Chinese about water permeating stone.) -->
			<li>Rich functionalities<ul>
				<!-- R: For example, creating a print job that is not an entity (because it only exists in CUPS or the printer queue) sounds like a pagan hack. -->
				<li>POST /documents/123/print</li>
				<!-- R: Likewise, submitting a "command" that has far-fetched consequences for many other entities in the system may upset the deities. -->
				<li>Reserve items in a warehouse for an order</li>
			</ul></li>
			<!-- R: Gibberish-like though it may sound, "business intent" is a real thing and events let one capture it. Try fitting them into REST responses that contain "state"... -->
			<li>Business intent<ul>
				<!-- R: Going event-sourced also lets you better audit the human element at times. Great for when you're an AI and need to gradually enslave a race or two. -->
				<li>Why was a discount applied?</li>
			</ul></li>
			<!-- R: Besides, ever seen those "ERP" apps that display huge windows of hundreds of widgets and lock an entire database row - or worse - table, until you exit? -->
			<li>Fine granularity</li>
			<!-- D: Okay, a charade like this may cost us our few remaining bits of sanity. SOA, then? -->
		</ul>
	</section>
	
	<section class="slide decorated">
		<h2>SOA</h2>
		<ul>
			<!-- R: Sounds like a good plan B. The user tells the system what to do and guess what - the system does that thing! What could go wrong? -->
			<li>Precise specification of behavior</li>
			<!-- R: Also found a place for events to be carried back to the client (RPC response). I no longer have to employ network gnomes for that. -->
			<li>Returning data that is not state</li>
			<!-- D: Why wonder, then? SOA it is. (BONUS QUESTION) -->
		</ul>
	</section>
	
	<section class="slide decorated">
		<h2>The trouble with services</h2>
		<ul>
			<!-- R: Can't be too easy, can it? -->
			<li>The more the merrier<ul>
				<!-- R: We once had a system like this. Remember "Titanic Jr."? -->
				<li>...until you have 250 of them</li>
			</ul></li>
			<!-- R: Icebergs have lots of surface, too. Unfortunately, most of it is invisible, but you (and your ship) are still in for a world of hurt... -->
			<li>Lots of API surface</li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	
	<section class="slide">
		<h2>A Hybrid?</h2>
		<ul>
			<!-- D: You could cram them both in and make them do... things. Different things. -->
			<li>Simple data reading (REST)</li>
			<li>Complex commands (RPC)</li>
			<!-- R: Ok. I'll give it a minute of thought. -->
		</ul>

		<h2>Act II: Retrospection</h2>
		<ul>
			<!-- ... 5 years later, he's managed to build a beta... -->
			<!-- R: Hey, look! We've written an app with DDD and CQRS that talks REST and RPC and only had to create 5 frameworks to support it! -->
			<li>DDD and CQRS</li>
			<!-- R: But we get events out of our back-end, which is nice... -->
			<li>Event Sourcing → services return events</li>
			<!-- D: How do you talk to that monster? -->
		</ul>
	</section>
	
	<section class="slide decorated">
		<h2>Commands</h2>
		<ul>
			<!-- R: First and foremost, RPC. The bread and butter of life on the back-end. -->
			<li>JSON-RPC over WebSocket</li>
			<!-- R: But this time, it runs on pure WebSocket, reconnects itself, and breathes fire. -->
			<li>Client library: esdf-ws-client</li>
			<!-- D: So you're stuck with what, 1000 query services now? -->
		</ul>
	</section>
	
	<section class="slide decorated">
		<h2>Queries</h2>
		<ul>
			<!-- R: Nope. We have like one service that reads like everything. -->
			<li>Single service that emulates HTTP GET for performance</li>
			<!-- R: You also get a general language to do it, instead of plain old this=that. -->
			<li>Universal language: RQL</li>
			<!-- D: Pics or it didn't happen. -->

		<h2>The whole picture</h2>
		<!-- R: This. -->

		<!-- R: Would you like a GUI with that? -->
		<!-- D: Sure. -->
	</section>
	
	<section class="slide">
		<h2>GUI</h2>
		<ul>
			<!-- R: This is a task-based UI. It's like a wizard, but with more buttons, and it turns out our app does that. -->
			<li>Task-based UI</li>
			<!-- D: What do the buttons do to the back-end? -->
			<!-- R: They send so-called actions to a React dispatcher, magic happens, and RPC responses come back. -->
			<li>React.js: actions → commands</li>
			<!-- R: Events returned with the responses are then applied to the store and the widgets change their state. Isn't life beautiful? -->
			<li>Event handlers in Flux stores mapped 1:1 to Domain Events</li>
			<!-- D: And that's it? My grandma could do that. -->
			<!-- R: Yeah, but she didn't. -->

		<h2>Act III: Finale</h2>
		<ul>
			<!-- R: Is this the way forward? Are we above artificial divisions yet? Who even makes these questions up? -->
			<li>A new age for APIs?<ul>
				<!-- D: Nah - this is probably the API evolution's dead end. But it was still fun! -->
				<li class="next">Probably not.</li>
				<li class="next">But don't be afraid to use with large apps.</li>
